# Amazon Tree Cover Loss Project

## Project Description

For this project, we explore the tree cover loss in the Amazon rainforest from 2001 to 2022, focusing on metrics such as the area of tree cover loss in hectares (Metric1) and its equivalent carbon emissions (Metric2). The data is sourced from [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/BRA/) and has been converted into a GeoJSON file.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze the changes in tree cover loss in the Amazon over the specified period. The web GIS application provides an interactive map that dynamically displays the extent of tree cover loss each year. Additionally, a table in the sidebar presents detailed information about tree cover loss metrics for each year.

## Application URL

## Main Functions

1. **Interactive Map:** The map displays the tree cover loss in the Amazon with a sliding scale that adjusts the opacity based on the Metric1 values.

2. **Table Display:** The sidebar contains a table presenting the year, Metric1 (tree cover loss in hectares), and Metric2 (CO2 equivalent) for each year.

3. **Legend:** A legend is included on the map to provide context for the thematic layer.
